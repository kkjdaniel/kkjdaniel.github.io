      <description>This site has always been more or less a glorified landing page, never really having a greater purpose than to redirect people to my relevant professional platforms. However, things are set to change with this new Hugo powered blog.
Over the coming months, I will be aiming to fill the site with an irregular schedule of technical content, that hopefully serves for some as interesting or helpful reading. For now, this post serves as an introduction to make the site look frankly less barren.</description>
