In the ongoing debate about the potential impact of AI on the job market, particularly within the technology sector, it’s important to address the widespread concerns that AI might soon render certain professions obsolete. Among these, the role of engineers is often spotlighted, with many speculating that advanced AI systems could one day replace human ingenuity in the field. As an engineer myself, I’d like to offer a thoughtful perspective on why I believe this scenario is far from imminent, and why the role of engineers will remain crucial for the foreseeable future.

It’s worth acknowledging that my perspective might seem biased—after all, advocating for the importance of my own profession could be seen as self-serving. This is not unlike the Luddites of the Industrial Revolution, who resisted new machinery out of fear for their livelihoods. However, despite this apparent conflict of interest, there are several compelling reasons why engineers will continue to be indispensable, even as AI technology advances.

First, let’s consider the concept of "peak AI," particularly in the context of generative AI, which directly impacts the field of engineering. Recently, a [Computerphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDUC-LqVrPU) delved into a [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04125) that highlights an emerging plateau in AI model performance. The study suggests that as the datasets used to train these models continue to expand, the gains in performance are diminishing. This plateau suggests that we may be approaching the limits of what current generative AI can achieve, especially in areas that require precision and deep contextual understanding—qualities that are essential in engineering.

At the core of this issue is the scarcity of specialised data needed to train AI models effectively. As companies push the boundaries of AI, they are increasingly constrained by the availability of high-quality data. For AI to make accurate predictions or generate reliable outputs, it must be trained on a vast array of scenarios. However, in reality, the data necessary to cover every conceivable situation is finite. While this limitation might be less problematic in creative domains, where there’s often no clear-cut right or wrong answer, it becomes a significant hurdle in engineering. Programming, for instance, requires precise, correct solutions—there is little room for approximation or error.

In programming, most problems have a limited set of correct solutions, much like how there are only a few syntactically correct ways to write a loop in any given language. This constraint means that AI models are left with a relatively narrow pool of data to train on, especially as the complexity and specificity of the problem increase. As a result, the more niche and contextualised a problem becomes, the less effective the AI’s solution is likely to be. In essence, the further it moves from the data points it has been trained on, the more it struggles to provide a viable solution.

Moreover, current benchmarks, such as those provided by [SWE-Bench](https://www.swebench.com/), demonstrate that AI can only independently solve less than 20% of real-world GitHub issues. When considering AI as a replacement for engineers, this statistic is telling. In real-world applications, this level of performance is far from adequate. Engineers are expected to solve complex problems with high accuracy, and relying on an AI that can barely tackle 20% of the issues it encounters would be impractical, if not outright disastrous.

There’s also a broader assumption that if we continue to increase the size of datasets, AI will eventually reach a level of "general intelligence" capable of addressing any problem it encounters. However, the data needed to solve the nuanced and context-specific challenges engineers face simply doesn’t exist at the scale required. Even if we had the necessary code, classifying and structuring it in a way that an AI could use effectively would be an immense, if not impossible, task.

This reality significantly curtails the prospect of AI fully replacing engineers. The idea of swapping out a highly capable human engineer for an AI that struggles with the majority of its tasks is far-fetched. Much like the development of autopilot technology did not eliminate the need for pilots—who still play a crucial role in overseeing and managing the flight—AI is not on the brink of replacing engineers. Even in scenarios where AI can augment the work of engineers, it still requires human expertise to guide, interpret, and correct its outputs.

Finally, it’s important to remember that the ability to effectively use AI is, in itself, a skill that only trained engineers possess. Prompting an AI, understanding its limitations, and critically assessing its outputs are capabilities that stem from a deep understanding of the field. AI, no matter how advanced, still relies on the human touch to be truly effective.

A key consideration stemming from this is the complexity of prompting AI systems, which often resembles a programming language in itself. The idea that you can simply give an AI a basic prompt and receive perfect code is inherently flawed, as even slight variations in wording can lead to significant errors.

This ambiguity inherently present in natural language makes building complex applications through simple prompts prone to error. As a result, engineers must often create more structured and detailed prompts, which ironically returns to the clarity and precision of traditional coding. Even then though, as explored before, the more detailed the prompt the further you drift from the AI's models which might ultimately render the output unuseable anyway. This highlights the ongoing need for skilled engineers who can manage both the complexities of programming and AI interactions.

Wrapping up, as AI models begin to plateau and underperform in SWE benchmarks, coupled with the inherent challenges of precise prompting, it’s evident that engineers will remain as vital as ever. Rather than replacing human expertise, AI will continue to serve as a powerful tool that complements and enhances the work of skilled engineers, but it will not supplant the fundamental ingenuity and problem-solving capabilities that define the profession. For without engineers both the input and output of AI models remains largely redundant.
